# Installation

You do this:

```
$ bunx htmx-bun
```

A `public` folder is created for you, and you can start dropping in static files, and create htmx-bun *partials* (`.part` files).

A more traditional start might be:

```
$ mkdir my-project && cd my-project
$ echo "{}" > package.json
$ bun i htmx-bun
$ bunx htmx-bun
```
